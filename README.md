# 30-days-hackerrank-coding-challenge
This is a 30 days challenge of coding, within it, and every day for 30 days, we will make a code for an assignment given by Hackerrank.

[HackerRank 30 days of code Challenge] (https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)

30 Days of Code is an opportunity for you to learn how to code or brush up on your fundamentals. Each day, you'll unlock a new challenge and a corresponding video tutorial to help you learn. The tutorial is Java-based, but you can also choose other popular languages to submit your solution, in my case I choosed C programing. Topics include if-else statements, recursion, data structures and more.
